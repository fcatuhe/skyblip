"""Build the drag-and-drop install artifact, and refuse to build a dangerous one.

    mkuf2.py <out.uf2> <in1.hex> [in2.hex ...]

The inputs are the two images sysbuild builds separately - MCUboot at
boot_partition and the signed, confirmed application at slot0 - which this script
merges. Sysbuild CAN merge them itself (SB_CONFIG_MERGED_HEX_FILES, Zephyr
doc/build/sysbuild/index.rst "Merged hex files"), but it merges each image's
default hex output, which for the application is the unconfirmed
`zephyr.signed.hex` - and the whole point here is the CONFIRMED image, see below.
Merging Intel HEX is a dozen lines on top of the parser this script already needs
for its range checks, so it does it here rather than taking a dependency on
`mergehex`.

The application image must be the *confirmed* one. A slot0 written directly by a
bootloader never goes through a swap, so it never gets a chance to mark itself
good, and an unconfirmed image would be reverted on the second boot.

The result is the single file a pilot drops on the TECHOBOOT volume.
It stays the only install artifact: a Nordic DFU package stores a real
bank_0_crc, which fails bootloader_app_is_valid() after the first MCUboot swap
(check_no_dfu_package.py).

The two range assertions are the point of this script. The factory Adafruit
bootloader will write any address inside
    USER_FLASH_START .. USER_FLASH_END  =  0x001000 .. 0x0EA000
(Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader src/usb/uf2/uf2cfg.h:25-26, ghostfat.c in_app_space),
and it does so without complaint. So:

  * A block below 0x026000 would land on the factory MBR + SoftDevice. Erasing
    those makes the device unable to run SoftRF/Meshtastic ever again and breaks
    the bootloader's own fallback DFU. Reversibility is a feature; guard it.
  * A block at or above 0x0EA000 is SILENTLY REFUSED by the bootloader - the
    copy appears to succeed and the device is left with a truncated image.
  * A block at or above 0x0F4000 would land on the factory bootloader itself.
    Unreachable today (it is past USER_FLASH_END), and checked anyway so that
    raising the ceiling can never take the recovery path with it: without that
    bootloader the device installs nothing without a programmer.

All three are cheap to check here and expensive to discover in the field.
