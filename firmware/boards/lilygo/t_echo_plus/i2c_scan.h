// What is actually on this board's sensor bus.
//
// One loop, so nothing downstream has to guess. Before this, the self-test page
// could say "BARO" but not which of the two declared BME280 addresses answered
// (the devicetree declares both because our BOM and LilyGO's own README
// disagree), the haptic driver's presence was a special case nobody had written,
// and the RTC that project/2-DEVICES.md:73 says is fitted had no evidence behind
// it at all.
//
// A zero-length write is the probe: it addresses the part and stops, which is
// what Zephyr's own i2c shell scan does and what every Arduino
// beginTransmission/endTransmission pair the references use amounts to
// (SoftRF platform/nRF52.cpp:1128-1163 probes the RTC, the IMU and the DRV2605
// exactly this way).
