// TI DRV2605 haptic driver, I2C 0x5A, with its enable line on a GPIO.
//
// This part exists because P0.08 on the T-Echo Plus is NOT a motor drive. LilyGO
// and Meshtastic call it PIN_DRV_EN / PIN_MOTOR_EN, and SoftRF identifies the
// Plus by finding a DRV2605 at 0x5A next to the BHI260AP
// (platform/nRF52.cpp:1158-1163, address at platform/nRF52.h:136). Driving that
// pin high brings the driver out of hardware standby and produces no pulse at
// all: the part needs a mode and a drive value over I2C before the motor moves
// (nRF52.cpp:2112-2133 configures it, 3383-3385 plays an effect, 2901 stops it).
//
// Register map and the ERM open-loop bring-up follow SensorLib's driver, which
// is the vendor library SoftRF uses: HapticDriver_DRV2605_Reg.hpp for the
// addresses and HapticDriver_DRV2605.cpp:410-456 for the sequence.
