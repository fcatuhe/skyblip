// Where a status dump leaves the device: the USB CDC console prj.conf already
// configures (zephyr,console = &cdc_acm_uart0). Lines only, no shell and no input
// - there is nothing on this device a laptop is allowed to command that the
// companion link does not already gate behind a button press on the glass.
//
// Two properties matter and both are the reason this is not four lines inline in
// main.cpp:
//
//  - It writes NOTHING until a host has raised DTR. CDC ACM is a UART with line
//    control (CONFIG_UART_LINE_CTRL), so "is anyone there" is a real question with
//    a real answer, and a device in a flight bag must not spend a milliamp
//    formatting five lines for nobody. A plain UART console has no line control
//    and is always attached, which is what the -ENOSYS case means.
//  - It goes through printk, which CONFIG_LOG routes into the deferred log
//    processing (LOG_PRINTK), so a host that opens the port and then stops reading
//    drops bytes instead of blocking the caller. This is called from the service
//    pass: a dump that blocked there would cost the watchdog, and the radio
//    executor runs above it precisely so that a dump can never cost a dwell.
