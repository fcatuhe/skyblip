// products/skyblip_go/settings.h: the config struct a pilot can change, its defaults,
// and the two framings it survives in: a versioned CRC blob for flash, JSON for
// the companion link. Validation is one function, so no path can store a value
// another path would refuse.
//
// Every field here has a reader outside this module. A page that accepts a
// setting the firmware ignores is worse than one that does not offer it, so a
// field that loses its last reader leaves the struct, the JSON and the schema
// together, and the blob layout is versioned so a device that stored the old
// one still comes back up as itself.
