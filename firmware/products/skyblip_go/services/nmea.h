//
// core/protocol/nmea_out.h has formatted $PFLAA/$PFLAU/$PGRMZ since the first
// week of the project and nothing in the product ever called it: the
// characteristic existed, the endpoint was routed, and a pilot who paired a
// tablet with a skyBlip Go saw an empty map. This is the producer. It owns the
// cadence, the rotation and the framing; it owns no geometry - relative position
// comes from core/protocol, the level from what core/traffic already decided.
