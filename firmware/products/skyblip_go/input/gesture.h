// products/skyblip_go/input/gesture.h: the gesture that authorises, as pure logic.
//
// This product ships with BLE pairing off, so there is no cryptographic proof
// that the phone asking for a firmware upload belongs to the pilot. Physical
// presence stands in for it, which makes the gesture the security boundary: it
// has to be something a thumb cannot produce by accident, and something that
// cannot be confused with the press that changes pages or with the hold that
// switches the device off.
//
// The one button already carries both of those. A double press is the third
// thing it can say, and it is the only one of the three that a pilot has to mean
// to make: two contacts inside a window a single deliberate press never spans.
//
// No framework, no clock of its own: the shell feeds debounced press edges and
// the time, which is what lets the simulator authorise through the same path.
