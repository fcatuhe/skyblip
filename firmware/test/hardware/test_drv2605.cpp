// The haptic driver, against its model.
//
// The bug this part exists to fix: pins.h named P0.08 "DRV haptic / vibration
// motor enable" and the annunciator drove it as a plain GPIO with a timer, so
// every claim in the test suite about the alarm escalating to vibration was a
// claim about a pin. On a T-Echo Plus that pin is a DRV2605's enable: raising it
// brings a waveform driver out of hardware standby and moves nothing at all. The
// first test below is that fact, and it fails against the old annunciator.
