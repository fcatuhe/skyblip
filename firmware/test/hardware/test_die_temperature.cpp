// The die temperature port, from the side that has no sensor.
//
// On this platform there is no silicon to read, and that is the case worth
// pinning: absent hardware is a capability, so the port answers "no reading" and
// leaves the caller's value exactly as it found it. Everything downstream depends
// on that one property - a status reply omits the key rather than publishing a
// zero, and a zero would read as 0.0 C, which is a perfectly plausible morning
// in a hangar and completely wrong.
//
// The nRF52840 side (hardware/platform/zephyr/die_temperature.h, Zephyr's
// temp_nrf5 driver on "nordic,nrf-temp") cannot be built on the host and is not
// reached from here. It needs CONFIG_SENSOR and CONFIG_TEMP_NRF5, and a bench
// reading beside a thermocouple before any number it produces is quoted.
