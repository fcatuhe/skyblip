// The thing being pinned down is that 1-ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1's "no flash work
// inside a dwell" has to be read as a statement about deadlines, because the
// dwell map leaves no unarmed phase to write in: 205..395 is the uplink dwell,
// 400..1200 the two M-band dwells own-ship keys the PA inside, and the only two
// gaps are the 5 ms retune guards, which are the worst place in the second for an
// 85 ms stall. So the cases below say where the stall IS allowed, and prove that
// the set is the one stretch the map's own numbers leave.
