//    2.1 §3.5.2 table 3-7, TS_HOP: 30 us typical for a 10 MHz synthesizer
//    step; the M-band hop here is 200 kHz (kMband1Hz - kMband0Hz), so the chip
//    settles inside this bucket with room left over. An error this small is
//    the radio doing exactly what its own datasheet promises, not a PPS or a
//    scheduling fault.
//  - kHopGuardMs (core/timing/slot.h), the smaller of the two slot-map
//    guards, paid at every M-band channel change.
//  - kJitterGuardMs (core/timing/slot.h), the guard both band edges keep, and
//    the figure core/timing/transmit.h's kCompletionSlackMs is drawn from.
//    Past this the error is not something the slot map budgeted for.
// A count outside the widest pair still lands somewhere: saturated into the
// outermost bucket, never wrapped, because a fault we cannot bound is one this
