// core/timing/durable_write.h: whether a durable write may start now, and how
// long one may wait. The single owner of that question.
//
// 1-ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1's "no flash work inside a dwell" is a statement about
// the nRF52840's INTERNAL flash: the NVMC owns the memory while it writes or
// erases, so the stall reaches every thread and every interrupt whose code lives
// there - the PPS latch (hardware/platform/zephyr/pps.h timestamps the edge
// inside the GPIO callback) and the SX1262's DIO1 among them - on the core that
// arms PPS-anchored deadlines. The dwell map (core/timing/slot.h) leaves no
// unarmed phase in the second: 205..395 is the uplink dwell, 400..1200 the two
// M-band dwells own-ship keys the PA inside, and the only gaps are the two 5 ms
// retune guards, which are the last place a stall belongs. So this does not look
// for a phase with no dwell in it. It places the whole stall where the CPU owes
// the radio nothing: inside an armed RECEIVE dwell, finishing a guard's width
// before that dwell has to be re-armed, clear of the window own-ship may key the
// PA in, and clear of the top of the second the anchor is latched on.
//
// What that costs is the receiver, and it is worth saying out loud: the dwell
// stays armed but the core is deaf to its reports for the length of the write, so
// one settings write is up to kWorstWriteMs of one channel not being heard. That
// is why the write is a request that coalesces rather than a call, and why the
// bound below is measured from the first change and not the last.
