// talking rather than where the slot formally ends: a skyPost uplink burst
// completes by 390 ms.

// INFO: fc 05aug26 kGroundEmitEnd is a completion deadline, not a start
// deadline. A full uplink frame is 10.44 ms of air at §C.4's 200 kbps
// (protocol::kUplinkBurstUs), so a burst begun at 390 would still be on air at
// 400, where the radio has already retuned. What this costs us is stated rather
// than discovered: §C.5 lets a ground station that is not ours begin one as late
// as 439.56 ms, and a third-party uplink in the back half of its own slot is one
// this dwell does not hear. test/core/test_uplink.cpp holds the arithmetic.
//
// The two M-band dwells are 400 ms and 400 ms, one channel each (§C.2.5 makes
// traffic alternate channels, so a receiver that never visits 868.4 MHz hears
// half of its neighbours). The second dwell therefore spans the UTC second: it
// opens at 800 ms and closes at 1200, which is 200 ms into the next second. That
// tail belongs to the dwell, not to the new second, and it is RECEIVE ONLY:
