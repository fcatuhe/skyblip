// core/traffic/sanity.h: what a decoded packet has to claim before it is allowed
// to be an aircraft.
//
// Every frame the table sees has already passed a CRC. That is not the same as
// being right: test/core/test_adsl.cpp counts silent miscorrections at the edge
// of the link budget and the count is not zero, and the O-band uplink adds
// Reed-Solomon miscorrection on top of it. A miscorrected position field decodes
// to a perfectly well-formed aircraft in the wrong place, and a ghost on the
// radar is worse than a missed target: it is the one failure that teaches a pilot
// to stop believing the instrument.
//
// So the gate is geometric, not statistical: a reception is only plausible if the
// position it claims is inside the range this radio could have heard it over.
// OGN does the same thing at 25 km and calls anything further a mis-decode
// (nrf52-ogn-tracker src/proc.cpp, the 25 km test it applies to every decoded
// packet before it enters its own traffic list).

//   about -107 dBm of receive sensitivity at the M band's 100 kchip/s with the
//   boosted gain of J1 - a bench figure, not a datasheet one;
//   dipole-referenced antennas at both ends and nothing at all in the way.

// That is 121 dB of budget, and free space at 868.2 MHz spends 120.8 dB of it by
// 30 km (32.4 + 20log10 f_MHz + 20log10 d_km, and test/core/test_traffic.cpp
// checks the figure still holds). A real
// installation loses several dB into a cockpit at each end, so the air-to-air
// figure in practice is a third of this: 30 km is a ceiling, never a promise.
//
// A ceiling is exactly what a sanity gate wants. It cannot hide a contact anyone
// could act on, because the alarm layer's outermost ring is 3 km
// (core/traffic/alarm.h kInfoDistM) and the radar's furthest range setting is
// well inside this figure, and it cannot be reached by a real transmitter on this
// band with this power. What is past it did not arrive over this link.

// which we cannot know from the frame and which is better than ours by
