// INFO: fc 03aug26 The per-unit trim, in millivolts, added to a reading before
// anything reads meaning into it. The divider ratio is a devicetree fact and
// Zephyr's voltage-divider driver owns the conversion, which is right; what it
// cannot know is this unit. Two 1% resistors put the ratio out by up to 2%,
// which at a full cell is 84 mV, and the SAADC's own gain and reference error
// adds to that - tens of millivolts, on a curve whose flat middle spends 250 mV
// crossing 60 percentage points. So one number, measured once on the line
// against a bench supply, and every later battery complaint is answerable.
//
// The bound is three times the divider's own worst case. Past it the reading is
// not out of trim, it is wired wrong or reading another rail, and a calibration
// field that accepts anything is a support incident of its own. It is enforced
// where the value enters the device (core/settings validates it, on the blob and
// on the JSON alike); nothing here re-checks it, only the arithmetic is kept
// from leaving the range a millivolt reading can hold.

// Readings become something a pilot can read. A 14 dBm burst sags the rail for
// exactly as long as it lasts, so the gauge takes the median of the last three
// readings rather than an average: a transient is discarded whole, while a cell
// that is really moving is followed within two samples. And a gauge that walks
// backwards while the cable is in is a bug report, so the percentage only moves
// the way the current flows until the direction itself changes.
//
// INFO: fc 03aug26 No time-remaining estimate here, and that is a decision, not
// an omission. OGN derives a drift rate from a 32-deep delay line on the voltage
// (nrf52-ogn-tracker src/proc.cpp:326-345) and a "40 minutes" reading is worth
// more to a pilot than "38%", so the reason has to be better than cost.
//
// It is this: minutes-remaining is percent divided by the SLOPE of the curves
// above, and those curves are the textbook shape for a generic Li-ion cell, not
// this pack measured on this board (the note on kDischargeCurve says so). An
// error of a few percent in the level is a few percent; the same error in the
// slope is a factor. Nothing else here is a guess about the future - the
// median-of-three, the two curves and the direction rule all describe a reading
// that has already happened - and a percentage is a statement of state a pilot
// discounts for himself, while a duration is a promise he plans a leg on. Two
// facts make the promise unbackable today: the fitted cell has no identified
// manufacturer or datasheet (project/research/enclosure-and-mount-go.md:59), and
// there is no measured power budget or runtime figure for any device state at
// all - not receive, not transmit, not sleep, not this panel. A figure
// a pilot reads has to trace to project/research/, and this one would trace to
// nothing.
//
// What unblocks it, and it is one bench day, not a quarter: a logged discharge
// of a fitted unit under the real dwell map, which the power budget needs
// anyway. That
// log fixes the curves, and with real curves percent falls linearly in time
// under a constant load, so the estimator is small and needs no new sampling -
// a fixed-depth ring of (percent, millisecond) pairs recorded on each whole
// percent step, rate taken across the ring, published only once the ring spans
// at least three percent, cleared whenever external power appears. Written down
// here so the next person implements the measured version rather than
// rediscovering why the unmeasured one was refused.
