// ports/flash_region.h: capability port: a contiguous region of NOR flash, with
// its erase granularity exposed rather than hidden.
//
// ports/kvstore.h is the other storage port and it is not this one. A key/value
// store owns its own layout, garbage-collects when it feels like it, and is
// mounted on the 32 KB internal partition where a write stalls the CPU. A flight
// log is an append-only stream on a 1.16 MB external partition where a write
// does not. The two have nothing in common but the word storage, so they are two
// ports and not one with a mode flag.
